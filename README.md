Project Overview
This project involves the creation of a comprehensive, interactive Insurance Data Analysis Dashboard using Power BI connected to a Microsoft SQL Server database. The dashboard is designed to provide key insights into policy details, customer demographics, and claim status/amounts for "Prism Insurance Private Limited."

The process included database setup, extensive data cleaning and transformation using Power Query, data modeling, and visualization design with advanced features like Row-Level Security (RLS) and report publishing/scheduling.

Key Features & Technologies:
Data Source & Extraction:	Microsoft SQL Server (database creation, flat file import), Power BI Desktop (Import Mode) to connect to SQL Server.
Data Transformation (ETL):	Used Power Query Editor for data inspection (column distribution, quality, profile), type checking/conversion, and feature engineering (creating Age Group and Policy Status columns using conditional logic). Loaded â‰ˆ10,000 rows.
Dashboard Design:	Implemented a professional dark color theme. Used various visual types including Card, Multi Row Card, Ribbon Chart, Stacked Bar Chart, Line Chart, Donut Chart, and Matrix.
Key Metrics Tracked:	Total Premium, Total Coverage, Total Claim Amounts, Policy Status (Active/Inactive), Customer Demographics (Gender, Age Group), Claim Status and Policy Type performance.
Interactivity & UX:	Customized Slicers for granular filtering (Policy Number, Claim Number, Customer ID). Demonstrated interactive filtering across all visuals.
Advanced Features:	Implemented and tested Row-Level Security (RLS) using the "Manage Roles" and "View As" features in Power BI Desktop to ensure secure, role-based data visibility.
Deployment:	Published the interactive report to Power BI Service, configured the workspace, and learned about scheduling data refreshes.

Dashboard Screenshots: The attached image illustrates the final dashboard layout and visual components.
